        According to a survey made on March 5, 2020, there have been nearly 20 veterans dying by suicide every day, about one and a half times as high as the civilian suicide rate, according to the most recent federal statistics. The percentage of veterans who considered taking their own lives before and after joining the military in the U.S. from 2014 to 2020 shows a noticeable increase throughout the timespan. It was found that 10 percent of respondents had considered suicide before joining the military, whereas 44 percent had considered suicide after joining the military.

        Many veterans nowadays don't get the help that they need or wait until they get out of service until they get helped. A lot of factors affect their decision whether to get help or not while in Active Duty. Most of the time, it's because service members don't want anyone to know that they have been going to behavioral health or because they will have to get out of duty if they get diagnosed with any mental health conditions.

    <p class="text-white">
        This Web Application called VetChat would give service members and veterans a way to express themselves freely without consulting a psychologist and having their mental health conditions recorded and imprinted on their careers. It is essential to have your mental health conditions recorded, but it should not interfere with your job and abilities in the workplace.

        Most service members and veterans can't talk about any details of what has been bothering them. Especially to their loved ones, most classified information can't be discussed publicly, or they don't understand the details of the story. Also, most behavioral health specialists don't relate to the veteran's story; thus, not giving them the proper help they need.
    </p>
    <p class="text-white">
        In VetChat, service members or veterans will register and create a profile for identification in which they have the control whether to have their profile visible or not to the eyes of the public. Although the web application is securely for veterans and service members only, most people want to stay anonymous to keep their identity private. In this manner, they can share their thoughts and experiences freely without exposing their true identity. Also, members of the group would have the ability to send help to any members who have some suspicious actions and members would have the availability to call any hotlines based on what they need in a click.
    </p>
    <p class="text-white">
        With the help of this Web Application, service members and veterans would be able to connect with other service members or veterans that can relate to his/her story or their experiences. Therefore, it gives them such freedom to talk about what has been bothering them and see that they are not alone. Having that feeling of not being the only person who has that problem would give relief to their minds and learn how other people cope with the same issues that they have.
